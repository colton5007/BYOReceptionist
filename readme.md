 <p>Welcome to the <b>Auto-Receptionist Creator</b> by Colton Sandvik. This is a unique utility that can help
    businesses of any size create an auto-responder and help route phone calls through their office space. You may be
    wondering how all of this is possible! It's simple, you use a flowchart style diagramming system that instructs the
    robo-receptionist to follow your every command... or at least most of them. This tool is easy to get up and going
    with just a Twilio account required to source the means of living for our little robo friend. To get started make
    sure your credentials are setup for Twilio and when they are, click start. This will let you start designing your
    new receptionist. Your receptionist has 5 basic features: <ul>
    <li>Speak - Which says something</li>
    <li>Redirect - Which ends the call and patches the connection to another number</li>
    <li>Directory - Which allows you to list a directory you design of callable numbers</li>
    <li>End Call- Which ends the call and must complete any command chain</li>
    <li>Options - Which allows you to branch these chains into different paths</li>
    </ul> We've included some pictures to help you get your bearings and get up and going! </p>
